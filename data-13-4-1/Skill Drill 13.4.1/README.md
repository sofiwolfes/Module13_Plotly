# Disney Skill Drill

Create a new directory, containing new index.html and script.js files. 
Use the D3.js library to create an event listener for a dropdown menu.

Your dropdown menu should contain the following names: 
Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy. 

When a character (e.g., Minnie) is chosen from the dropdown menu by a user, the character's name should be printed to the browser console.
